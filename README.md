# Analysis of paper: Fairness via Representation Neutralization

We implemented the algorithm in the paper for the dataset - Law School Admission Data and perform comparisons with different machine learning and deep learning models combined with different fairness strategies.

# Contents

- `Python_Notebooks` folder contains:
  
  - `DL-Final-Submission.ipynb` contains DL model with RNF.
  
  - `ML-model.ipynb` contains ML model with and without bias mitigation.
  
  - `Without-RNF.ipynb` contains the DL model without RNF.

- `Images` folder contains screenshots of important plots involved in analysis.

- `Final-Project-Submission-Deep-Learning.pdf` contains the final report for the project. 

# Important Requirements

- Python 3.7.13

- Torch version - 1.11.0+cu113

- Fairlearn v0.7.0
